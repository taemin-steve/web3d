# To Do

You guys are supposed to do the following:
- Set up your GIT and Be ready for the contributor of "https://github.com/korfriend/web3d.git"
- Make your working folder (e.g, your account name) under this folder (you can use your own branches but the final "push" must be the master branch)
- Using the skeleton codes, which prof.Kim provided, complete the codes to satisfy the bellow specification

### Specification:
- Replace the camera controls provided by the OrbitControl module with your own control codes
- Use the mouse event via JavaScript event callbacks (refer to the skeleton code)
- Camera translating along the viewing direction (zooming effect in the perspective mode), panning, rotating

### Progress
1. Explore a number of Object3D and Matrix4 provided by THREE.js, and try them. (July. 29th)
2. Understand what the matrix transformations are in terms of the graphics pipeline, e.g., transformations between the screen space, projection space, camera space, and world space. (Aug. 2nd)
3. Understand what the matrix transformations are in terms of model transformation, e.g., transformations between the scene's world space and local space, and learn how .matrix and .matrixWorld are set up and behave. (Aug. 5th)
4. Complete the transformations both in model transformations and in graphics pipeline transformations. (in progress...)
