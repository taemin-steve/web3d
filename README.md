# Welcome guys :)
In this project course, you guys are supposed to study
- Web programming with JavaScript
- High-level graphics API with <a href="https://threejs.org/">THREE.js</a>
- Basics of geometry algebra
- And some coding experiences with simple / challenging examples :)

### In this page
I will provide the basic skeleton codes for you guys to get started into the practices.

### Keep in mind
When you need discussion/or QA/ or news about our group, go to the <a href="https://github.com/korfriend/web3d/discussions">Discussion</a> page. 
In this project course, I will not teach the coding languages but you guys must learn the coding language details by yourself.
Even though you don't have prior experience in JavaScript and its relavant libraries, you should be able to understand object-oriented programs and modify them.

Are you scared? :)

First, try it and get into the practices along with your team members!

If you are ready, go to the "students" folder.
